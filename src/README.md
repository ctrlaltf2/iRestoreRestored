# Building
To build this, Eclipse will be required. Follow the guide at https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/creating-a-blank-spigot-plugin-in-eclipse/ up to step 2, then copy the src/ folder to your project folder. After that, download the latest MyPet plugin jar and the latest Vault plugin jar, link them in a similar way, then link the craftbukkit-1.12-2.jar in your Spigot server install location as well. Then you should be able to build by following step 8 of the blank plugin guide.
